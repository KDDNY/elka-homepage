# elka-mpiotro4-homepage
My homepage in university student server.
This page is my resume and portfolio. I've tried to keep it as simple as possible so it's made only with html5 and css.
Probably whole code "smells" and requiers serious refactor but im not an web developer and learned html only in order to make this website.
